# The Color Crafter

The Color Crafter is a web application that aims to save designers, web developers and UX designers time in finding a color palette for their project.

It allows the user to choose a color or generate a new one at random. Once selected the color and see the color palette that brings, the user can click on the color you want and this is automatically copied to the clipboard.

It also shows to the users examples of the selected color in some graphic pieces, and see the contrasts that are created when using that color.
